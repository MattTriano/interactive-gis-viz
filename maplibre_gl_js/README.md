# MapLibreGL js

## Example code

### Ex01

A very bare bones map that has a point at the equator and the basemap.

### Ex02
This is a slightly more interactive example. It includes a toggle checkbox to turn a layer (containing that point at (0,0)) on and off, and it also displays the latitude and longitude of wherever the user clicks. Kind of neat.
